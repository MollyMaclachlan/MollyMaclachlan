<h1 align="center">Murdo Maclachlan</h1>

I'm Murdo, a Scottish software engineering student ([graduand](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/graduand), technically) who mostly uses Java and Python and has far too many hobbies and a remarkable skill for procrastination.

<h2 align="center">Quick Links</h2>

**[My website](https://murdomaclachlan.github.io/website)** probably contains most information you might be looking for.

<h2 align="center">Experience</h2>

I'm most experienced in Java and Python. I'm also fairly experienced with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I use Eclipse for Java, and VSCode ([VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), strictly speaking) for everything else.

I have some lesser experience in the following languages (alphabetical order): C, Erlang, Lua, OCaml, PHP, R, Shell, SQL

The projects I'm currently working on through this account are:

- **[pipupdater](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/pipupdater)**, a Python command-line tool to automatically update any out-of-date packages reported by [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).
- **[smooth_logger](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/smooth_logger)**, a simple Python logging library that lets you customise various logging scopes and whether they will be printed or saved to the log file.
- **[smooth_progress](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/smooth_progress)**, a simple Python progress bar that can be integrated with the above library.
- **[Word Search](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/WordSearch)**, a very simple Java auto-generator and auto-solver for word search puzzles, which currently needs much more development.

Some projects I've worked on in the past include:

- **[oscr](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/oscr)**, **[tadr](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/tadr)** and **[torcf](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/torcf)**, command-line Python tools that interfaced with the Reddit API to streamline the transcribing process for members of the now shuttered [r/TranscribersOfReddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/new/) project.

Programming projects of mine elsewhere:

- **[No Dismemberment or Finishers](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/8154)**, a mod for *The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt* that disables in-combat dismemberment and slow-motion finishers.
- **[Goromorg](https://www.nexusmods.com/legendofgrimrock2/mods/170)**, **[Tunnel Ogre](https://www.nexusmods.com/legendofgrimrock2/mods/140)**, and **[Skeleton Warrior](https://www.nexusmods.com/legendofgrimrock2/mods/136)**, three mods for *The Legend of Grimrock 2* that import enemies from the previous game as assets for custom dungeon creation.

I also have a few small Bash scripts:

- **[installsp](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/installsp)**, for streamlining the installation of Slackware packages and moving them to a local repository.
- **[sytdl](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/sytdl)**, for shortening the argument syntax of youtube-dlp, because I'm lazy.
